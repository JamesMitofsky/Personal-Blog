        <p>I am a researcher and activist focused on humanitarian crises and transatlantic cooperation.</p>

        <p>As democracy is further endangered by new behaviors and dynamics around the globe, I&apos;m interested in how to preserve our communication and protect a global order of peace. I believe the problems of this moment demand new ways of thinking about multilateral collaboration.</p>

        <p>I&apos;ve volunteered for the Red Cross (la Croix Rouge Fran√ßaise) and published research with Tufts&apos; Institute for Democracy and Higher Education (IDHE). These experiences shape how I think about the intersection of policy, diplomacy, and humanitarian action, and I&apos;m constantly learning from others who share my motivation to help the world through policy.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Vermont&apos;s Northeast Kingdom, spent three years in Caen, France, and currently live in Bonn, Germany. I speak French fluently and have notions of German.</p>
