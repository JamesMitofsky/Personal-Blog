Living in Caen, France, I've often found myself in conversations contrasting Donald Trump with Kamala Harris. Most people here recognize that Trump's approach is extreme, even erratic. Yet, often, there's a sense that Kamala Harris represents only a superficial shift in American politics—just a new face in a system defined by its instability.

From my perspective, shaped by experiences in both countries, the distinction is stark: the democratic ideals of the United States (and even the Republican vision a decade ago, before Trump's influence) differ profoundly from Trump's current platform.

America has a duty to be a stable, reliable partner on the world stage. It's concerning when our allies are left wondering if our values are constant or subject to drastic change. This ambiguity reflects a failure in our current system, where the choice between two profoundly different candidates can seem unclear. While it's true the French citizenship is not the primary audience for electoral messaging it should be obvious—even across borders, and no less in our two party system—that candidates like Trump and Harris represent fundamentally different directions for the country.

Despite the confusion that remains in Europe about whether these candidates are very different or smaller variations on the same theme, it is crucial that we take steps to further engage not just with the diplomats of countries where we have a presence but encourage cultural exchanges. Of ideas, students, and languages. This is the path toward clearer political communication and stronger transatlantic relationships.
