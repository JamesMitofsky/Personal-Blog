# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post written in markdown. The blog now uses local markdown files instead of a CMS, making it simpler to manage content and easier to version control.

## Features

- Markdown support with frontmatter
- Local file system based
- Tags support
- Author information
- Related posts
- Local image handling

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Feel free to edit this post or add new ones by creating markdown files in the `posts` directory. Each post should include a hero image in the `public/post-images` directory, referenced in the frontmatter.
