Higher education frequently advertises living and learning abroad as a rich opportunity, but the number of students who take advantage of this is relatively small; only ~9% of American university students studied abroad in 2024 according to the U.S. Open Doors Report. This is striking considering most Americans lack bachelor's degrees (Pew Research Center), excluding them from traditional international study. The alternatives can be disruptive and age-restricted, like Australia’s holiday working visa. These narrow pathways to meaningful time abroad exclude most Americans.

Bridging this gap, the U.S. Department of State should sponsor a transatlantic exchange program for trade workers, encouraging the movement of knowledge and culture.

A trade exchange would be a practical way for adults in a trade field to experience life abroad with greatly reduced complexity and financial hardship. For the worker, there is guaranteed employment for the duration of the stay—so participants who have loans or a mortgage will be able to keep those financial commitments—and meanwhile at their original worksite, their job is secure and temporarily filled by the other worker in the exchange.

For instance, American electricians could exchange with German counterparts for 3-6 months, gaining technical innovations while sharing American methods. Similarly, American wheat farmers could partner with those from New Zealand or (one day) Ukraine.

This has summarily covered the problem and a solution, but what is the real policy objective behind exchanging workers? More than industry, it has civic aspirations to build international relationships and increase tolerance for other ways of life. I grew up in a town of 800 in rural Vermont, but I have also spent three years in France. Living somewhere liquifies all sorts of barriers that are otherwise solid during a week-long visit. Time spent in community is essential.

During her tour with the German Marshall Fund’s Whistlestops for Ukraine, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States described the agricultural similarity of her home and Iowa during her stop in Des Moines. In my view, this comparison is right, and having those farmers spend time living together is just an extension of her thinking.

In "After Europe," Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev describes how the working class who feel left behind by an increasingly globalized world should be taken seriously, lest they turn to autocracy. Now, as countries are becoming increasingly nationalistic, an exchange program that focuses on adults—rather than forfeiting them as a lost cause—is a way to organically increase tolerance for other cultures and ways of life. As nationalism threatens to divide our world, this worker exchange program offers a pragmatic antidote—creating thousands of personal bridges between countries, fostering mutual respect through shared labor, and ultimately achieving peace through citizen diplomacy that builds lasting foundations for international cooperation.
