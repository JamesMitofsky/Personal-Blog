The rural beauty of Vermont marked my childhood, but so did abuse. That began to change when I joined Hazen's debate team, led by David Kelley. He taught us to speak simply and seek deep truths, volunteering his legal expertise and creating access for the students of Craftsbury Academy.

One evening just before the start of my senior year, given the chance to escape my unsafe home, I called David Kelley. He drove to meet me downtown within the hour. When it became clear I could not return, going beyond legal advice, he and his wife took me in. They clothed, fed, and cared for me, paying legal dues and bearing emotional tolls to protect me from further abuse. I saw their lives up close. The resilience and hard work of these people cannot be overstated.

I spent countless hours with David that year. His dedication and selflessness were evident every day, and it extended to each person we met. He offered help freely and with humility, and when he said something would be done, it was.

I was not born into David's world, but I was lucky enough to pass through it. I know the nature of this man. His good humor, detailed thinking, and unwavering commitment to community have profoundly shaped my life. These same qualities will resonate in our Brave Little State's halls of Montpelier.

I wholeheartedly support David Kelley for the Vermont House of Representatives. Join me and vote for him on Tuesday, August 13th in the Democratic Primary.
