## How it all began

### The same problems again & again

International students arriving to Caen face a series of identical challenges, but without a guide organizing the most important steps they should take, each student tackles these problems uniquely. This guide aims to centralize information about the most common hurdles foreign students face.

### My journey

I came to Caen as a student in January of 2022, and adjusting to life here (especially the bureaucracy) has been a long and winding road! I've jumped through many hoops, changed living arrangements a few times, changed jobs, and completed one degree and several certifications. In all that time, there are a few things I wish I'd known sooner! This guide is, thus, an summary of those bits and pieces. If you have any questions, get in touch! I'd be glad to help out.

## Disclaimers

### It's all my opinion

It's on purpose that this is written with an editorial voice. That's to say: these are my opinions!

The options I list aren't exhaustive, just the ones I've had good experiences with. Ultimately, use your judgement. If you'd like something that's more a list of things to do, maybe check out this [brochure from Campus France](https://ressources.campusfrance.org/pratique/villes/en/Caen_en.pdf).

### This guide is in English

Considering it's likely the people who struggle with speaking French that will have the most trouble navigating French life (like me when I arrived), this guide is written in English and I've tried to ensure that links to French websites automatically lead to English translated version.
